# Monokai-mod-sublime-json
This is a theme based on a json port of Monokai with a few tweaks to make it darker.

Why did I make this? Because I liked Monokai – it's the best dark theme for sublime; except for the grey background. I wanted a black background. Also I wanted a JSON version that was easier to edit and read.

To install this:

1. Create a Theme folder inside the Packages folder. On Mac the path would be `~/Library/Applciation Support/Sublime Text 3/Packages`
1. Put this file in there
1. Select `Preferences -> Color Scheme` from the Sublime applicaton menu and you should see the new theme there.
